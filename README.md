# Pendulum-Modeling
A simple pendulum is built with adjustable length and mass. Data of the motion of the pendulum in various setups are recorded. They are used to verify the correctness of the model provided and generate a new model that predicts the motion of the pendulum built within uncertainties.  

Initial Model.py fits the original model, which is exponential decay onto the data, and see how well it fits.
Refitting Model.py changes the predicted parameters from the initial model into variables, and will find these parameters using curve fit.
